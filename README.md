## 📊 Project Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Data Visualization** on the classic Iris dataset. The goal is to understand the structure and patterns within the dataset and extract meaningful insights about different Iris species based on their features.

## 🌼 Dataset Description
The Iris dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers divided into 3 species:
- **Iris Setosa**
- **Iris Versicolor**
- **Iris Virginica**

## 🚀 Features
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Statistical Summary
- Data Visualization:
    - Pair Plots
    - Histograms
    - Box Plots
    - Correlation Heatmap
- Insights about Feature Distributions and Species Differences

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (optional for preprocessing)
