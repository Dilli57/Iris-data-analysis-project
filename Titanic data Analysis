# Titanic Data Analysis 🚢

## 📊 Project Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Data Visualization** on the famous Titanic dataset. The goal is to analyze the dataset to uncover insights about the factors affecting passenger survival during the Titanic disaster.


## ⚓ Dataset Description
The Titanic dataset contains information about passengers on board the Titanic, including:
- Passenger demographics (Age, Sex, etc.)
- Ticket information (Class, Fare, Embarked port)
- Survival status (Survived or Not)

The dataset is commonly used for machine learning and data analysis tutorials.



## 🚀 Features
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Statistical Summary
- Visualizations:
    - Distribution of Survivors
    - Survival Rates by Gender, Class, Age Group
    - Correlation Heatmap
    - Histograms and Box Plots
- Key Insights about factors influencing survival


## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python 3.x  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn (optional for preprocessing)
